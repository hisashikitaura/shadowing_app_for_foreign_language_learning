            I will make a shadowing practice app for {language_name} Language Learners.
            In shadowing practice, a teacher (may be a computer) reads a {language_name} sentence by sentence aloud, and learners repeat at the same pace, with a slight delay if possible.
            
            As for the {language_name} materials, generate {language_name} text for {language_name} Language Learners.
            -- Topic: {topic}
            -- Number of the sentences: Approx. {num_sentences}                
            -- Skill level: {level}, defined by the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR)
            Just the text. No words needed.
            No numbering at the beginning of the sentences.
            Enclose each sentence in <p> tag.
